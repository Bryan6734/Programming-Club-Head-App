            <p>
              I use GitHub frequently and am familiar with the Git workflow of opening issues, creating branches, commiting/pushing changes, and
              opening/merging pull requests. Check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bryan6734">Github here!</a>.

            <h3>Frontend / Backend</h3>
            <p>
              For the ratemycourse.org website, I built the frontend using React.js and pure CSS (with dynamic resizing for mobile devices). The
              website gets & posts data from a MongoDB database.

              I've scraped the MyMilton Directory a number of times for various projects, including the Face Guesser and a Students API which has data
              on students, their parents, their advisors, and phone numbers.

              picture. I would be willing to help implement this for Gotcha.

          <p>
            Imagine if we had a competition to design the worst, most impractical UI. This is something that the CS-1 students could do at the end of
            the year (maybe each student submits individually or each section submits one entry).
          </p>

          <h3 class="idea">2. Beginner CS Helpers</h3>
          <p>
            It would be nice if students in CS-3 or CS-4 could devote some of their free periods to coming and helping students in CS-1.
            Alternatively, we could have CS-2 students present on cool things CS-1 ppl might want to add to their game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ms. Killiam sent me a spreadsheet containing all the period where CS-1 students have class; we could send out an email asking if people
            would be willing to help.

          <p>
            As part of the Sustainability Board, I've been working with Gunner and some of the people on the board to get Commutr (a carpooling app
            for day students) up and going.

          <h3 class="idea">5. Programming Club Website</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine if, at the end of the year, every single student in the lower levels could submit their proudest project to be featured on a
            website. I love making websites and would be so down to implement a "portfolio" page for the CS department.
